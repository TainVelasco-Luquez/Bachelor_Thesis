# Script description
The main objective of this script is to validate the human interactome (HI) assembled in the HIassembly.Rmd file. Definition of functions and generation of plots are included. For further details refer to the main document of the thesis. Style guide is followed according to the [ R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml#filenames) 

## Function definitions
### Single legend for multiplot
When unifying several plots into one, it is useful to have a single legend for all of them, and thus avoiding redundancy and saving space for the important information. This function was taken from (stackoverflow)[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12539348/ggplot-separate-legend-and-plot] and modiefied according to (STHDA)[http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-easy-way-to-mix-multiple-graphs-on-the-same-page-r-software-and-data-visualization] and all credit is for them.
```{r single_legend, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
get_legend <- function(myggplot){
  tmp <- ggplot_gtable(ggplot_build(myggplot))
  leg <- which(sapply(tmp$grobs, function(x) x$name) == "guide-box")
  legend <- tmp$grobs[[leg]]
  return(legend)
}
```

## Packages
```{r library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Packages <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "org.Hs.eg.db", "readr", "KEGGREST", "KEGGgraph", "parallel", "foreach", "org.Hs.eg.db", "doParallel", "igraph", "tictoc", "intergraph", "ggnetwork", "ggnet", "gridExtra", "poweRlaw", "ergm"); lapply(Packages, library, character.only = TRUE); rm(Packages)

# Interactome description
## Files import
```{r file_importing, message=FALSE, warning=FAlSE}
interactome_ready <- readRDS("Data/Individual/interactome_ready.rds")

interactomeGraph <- graph_from_data_frame(interactome_ready, directed = FALSE)
is.connected(interactomeGraph)
```

The interactome is a connected igraph network, with `r vcount(interactomeGraph)` vertices and `r ecount(interactomeGraph)` edges. It is a multilayer graph as it has `r sum(is.multiple(interactomeGraph, eids = E(interactomeGraph)))` multiedges and`r sum(is.loop(interactomeGraph, eids = E(interactomeGraph)))` loops, the former represent edges supported by multiple sources (*i.e* PPI, regulatory or metabosignal). In order to reduce multidimensonality, the interactome is going to be transformed into a simple graph, where an edge weigth is proportional to the number of sources supporting such interaction:
    
```{r simple_interactome, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Counting multiple edges and assigning it to a new edge attribute, "Weight"
E(interactomeGraph)$Weight <- count.multiple(interactomeGraph)

# Simplifying the interactome
interactomeGraph <- simplify(interactomeGraph, remove.loops = TRUE, remove.multiple = TRUE) 

# Checking
is.simple(interactomeGraph)
```

Despite its massiveness, just as many real-world networks, the HI displays a relative small diameter: `r diameter(interactomeGraph)`.

##  Centrallity measures 
### Degree ($k$)
Represents the number of edges ($L$) per node, calculated as: $$L = 1/2 \sum_{i=1}^N {k_i}$$

Average degree per vertex ($<k>$): `r mean(degree(interactomeGraph, normalized = FALSE))`

Median degree: `r median(degree(interactomeGraph, normalized = FALSE))`

Maximum degree: `r max(degree(interactomeGraph, normalized = FALSE))`

Minimum degree: `r min(degree(interactomeGraph, normalized = FALSE))`

The cumulative distribution of the degree has a heavy tailed form, indicating that there is a greater chance to randomly select a node with low degree ($k < 20$) than selecting a node with high degree, also known as hubs:

### Scale-freeness
Several real world networks, in contrast to random ones, follow a power law degree distribution and thus are called scale-free. Such kind of networks inherits another properties, such as the acheeles heel property and the presence of hubs, therefore it is important to assess scale-freeness to see if the interactome may inherits such properties. In order to assess if our data follows such a degree distribution, the scaling parameter ($\alpha$) and the lower cutoff ($x_{min}$) are going to be calculated [@Clauset:2009iy]. Firstly, an accurate estimation of the $x_{min}$ is required to ensure the accuracy of the maximum likelihood estimator of the scaling parameter $\alpha$ [@Clauset:2009iy]. The method to be used selects the $x_{min}$ that minimises the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (K-S) between our data and the best-fit power-law distribution [@Gillespie:2015hb]:

```{r powerlaw_1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Extracting the degree of interactomeGraph
degInteractome <- igraph::degree(interactomeGraph,
                         normalized = FALSE,
                         v = V(interactomeGraph))

# Creating the discrete power-law distribution object to be compared against the discrete poisson distribution  (dispois)
interactomeGraphPower <- displ$new(degInteractome)

# Estimating xmin with an upper cutoff of max(degree), to cope with all variation in the range of degree values
interactomeGraphPower$setXmin(estimate_xmin(interactomeGraphPower, 
                                           xmins = NULL, 
                                           pars = NULL, 
                                           xmax = max(igraph::degree(interactomeGraph,
                                                                     normalized = FALSE)),
                                           distance = "ks"))
```

The resulting value of $\alpha$ is `r interactomeGraphPower$getPars()` for an $x_{min}$ value of `r interactomeGraphPower$getXmin()`, meaning that the power law is valid for `r get_ntail(interactomeGraphPower, prop = FALSE, lower = FALSE)` nodes in the degree range range `r interactomeGraphPower$getXmin()`$<k<$ `r interactomeGraphPower$getXmin() + get_ntail(interactomeGraphPower, prop = FALSE, lower = FALSE)`. This result is critical as most power-law estimations are inspected visualy and counting for such distribution along all the dataset, which is not an accurate picture of what is the true distribution of the dataset in a specific range [@Clauset:2009iy]. Notwithstanding the relative short $k$ interval fitting a power law, to estimate the uncertainty in these power law parameters, the K-S is calculated from 100 simulations with bootstrapping of synthetic data sets following a power law distribution, with the same $\alpha$ and $x_{min}$ as our data set (*id est* once the K-S between the observed $P(k)_{HI}$ and the fitted power-law parameters is calculated, the same procedure is repeated n-simulations times but between fictional power-law, with the same parameter as the observed, and their corresponding power-law fit to a true power-law), to subsequently calculate the statistic significance (p-value) of the power-law interval [@Clauset:2009iy]. 

```{r powerlaw_2, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# To stablish if the power law distribution is plausible, a boostrapping hypothesis test is carried out
tic();bootsinteractomeGraphPower <- bootstrap_p(interactomeGraphPower, no_of_sims = 1000, threads = detectCores() - 1, seed = 0);toc() # 101.094 sec elapsed

# extracting the p-value
bootsinteractomeGraphPower$p

# Extracting the K-S of the observed
bootsinteractomeGraphPower$gof
```

The p-value represents the fraction of comparisons where the K-S of synthetic power law data is greater than the K-S distance of the empirical data [@Clauset:2009iy]. Therefore, a $p_{value} = 0.50$ means that, in the 50 % of comparisons, the K-S of the observed data set was closer to a power-law distribution than the K-S of synthetic power law samples, thus, there is a probability of 5 (p-value) in 10 that our data set follows a power-law distribution in the aforementioned range. The decision rule stands that the power law is ruled out if $p_{value} \leq 0.1$, however, large $p_{value}$ does not necessarily means a power law fit, as @Clauset:2009iy explain, consequently, a comparison against a discrete Poisson distribution, which fits to random networks, is going to be performed employing the likelihood ratio of Vuong’s test:

```{r powerlaw_3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# The discrete Poisson distribution is fitted 
interactomeGraphPoisson <- dispois$new(degInteractome)

# Setting the same lower cutoff
interactomeGraphPoisson$setXmin(interactomeGraphPower$getXmin())

# Setting the parameter z of the Poisson distribution
interactomeGraphPoisson$setPars(estimate_pars(interactomeGraphPoisson))
```

The likelihood ratio test is a method to compare the likelihood of the observed data ($P(k)_{HI}$) under two competing distributions; the higher the likelihood the better fit [@Clauset:2009iy]. One can also calculate the log of the ratio of likelihood, which is positive or negative depending on which distribution is better, or zero in the event of a tie [@Clauset:2009iy]. However, for that to hold, one must ensure that the observed sign is positive or negative enough that it could not plausibly be the result of a chance fluctuation, which is carry out employing the Vuong’s test to calculate the $\sigma$ (standar deviation) as a measure of fluctuation of the log-likelihood sign value. The null hypothesis of the Vuong’s test stands that both classes of distributions, power-law and poisson, are equally far from the true distribution [@Gillespie:2015hb], therefore a $p_{value} < 0.1$ meas that it is very unlikely that the log-likelihood sign obeys chance fluctuations and the sign is a reliable indicator of which model is the better fit to the data. On the contrary,a $p_{value} > 0.1$ the sign is not reliable and the test does not favor either model over the other. Consequently, it is expected that the Vuong’s test, rejects the Poissonian distribution, indicating that a non-random process is taking place, therefore, strengthening the power law as the distribution that best fits the data (note that a large number of distributions can be fitted, thus, the statement only concern the distributions contemplated in the comparison) in the specified range. for power-law the plot of the log-likelihood ratio of Vuong’s test goes towards $+ \infty$, and for lo-like distributions (*e.g.* exponential distribution) goes towards $- \infty$

```{r vuong_plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Figure 2. Power law distribution better fits the P(k) of the HI than the poisson distribution, indicating that there is a biological underlying process generating such distribution of the degree."}

# Visualising the result of the Vuong’s test
# Extracting the log-likelihood ratio (\mathcal{R}) to plot it in ggplot2
plVSpois <- compare_distributions(interactomeGraphPower, interactomeGraphPoisson)$ratio
names(plVSpois) <- c("k", "R")

# Adding the distribution from which the comparison against poisson is comapred
plVSpois$Distribution <- "Power-law"

plVSpoisPlot <- ggplot(data = plVSpois, aes(x = k, y = R)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Degree (k)", y = "Normalised Log-likelihood Ratio")
plVSpoisPlot

# The log-likelihood value
compare_distributions(interactomeGraphPower, interactomeGraphPoisson)$test_statistic

# P-value for the log-likelihood sign
compare_distributions(interactomeGraphPower, interactomeGraphPoisson)$p_two_sided

# P-value to see if the first distribution is more closer to the P(K) than the second one
compare_distributions(interactomeGraphPower, interactomeGraphPoisson)$p_one_sided
```

The sample average of the log-likelihood ratio of Vuong’s test, standarised by its $\sigma$ (standar deviation), is positive (`r compare_distributions(interactomeGraphPower, interactomeGraphPoisson)$test_statistic`), indicating that the power law compared against the Poisson, is the distribution which best fit $k$ in the range $55<k<362$. This is also shown in figure 2, where the log-likelihood ratio goes towards $+ \infty$, hence, rejecting the null hypothesis of the Vuong’s test. Inasmuch as the log-likelihood ratio is subjected to statistical fluctuation, it is essential to assess quantitatively whether its positive value is statistically relevant. For that purpose, the two sided $p_{value}$ = `r compare_distributions(interactomeGraphPower, interactomeGraphPoisson)$p_two_sided` points out that is very unlikely that such positive value of the log-likelihood ratio obeys a serendipitous value of the ratio's fluctuations, instead, indicating that, certainly, it is a reliable indicator that the $P(k)$ do not follows a Poisson distribution and that the power-law is plausible in the mentioned range.

Now lets compare the observed degree distribution against the exponential distribution, as the HI present a bimodal (two local maximum) $P(k)$ inherited from regulatory interactions which follows an exponential instead of a power-law distribution in their  $P(k)$ [@Marbach:2016jx supplementary fig 6-8]:
```{r vuong_plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=""}

As seen in the plot which goes towards $- \infty$ with a significant negative value, the exponential distribution fits better the $P(k)_{HI}$ than the poisson distribution, indicating that the HI brain-specific here constructed is not drawn from randomness.

KNN indicates the way in which nodes of a given degree tend to interact with each other, however, it only works with simple graphs (not multilayer ones), therefore it is required that the interactomeGraph gets rid off the multiedges.
```{r knn, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#To convert the multi layer or multiple graph to a weighted one, based upon the number of edges between a pair of vertices:
interactomeGraphKNN <- interactomeGraph
E(interactomeGraphKNN)$weight <- 1
interactomeGraphKNNWeighted <- simplify(interactomeGraphKNN)

E(interactomeGraphKNNWeighted)$weight

interactomeGraphKNN <- knn(interactomeGraphKNNWeighted, vids = V(interactomeGraphKNNWeighted), weights = NULL)
```

```{r knn_plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= "Figure 4. High-degree nodes tend to interact indiscriminately with high-degree and low-degree nodes", fig.align="center", warning=FALSE}
pdf(file = "Figures/interactomeGraphKNN.pdf")
plot(interactomeGraphKNN$knn, log = "xy", col = "goldenrod", xlab = c("Log-Degree"), ylab = c("Log Average Neighbor Degree"))

### Small-world property
A network exhibit the small-world effect [@Watts:1998db] if, despite having a high clustering coefficient, exhibit a short path lenght. Such property, just as the scale-freeness, have been linked to real world effect and explain the expedite information flow troughout the network, indispensable to carry out the cellular process with efficiency/efficacy/speed.

# Interactome validation
In order to asses the validity of the topological features, and more broadly, of the human interactome brain-specific, such features are going to be compared against the random expectation of simulated networks. The premise is that the different the observed features in the interactome from the random ones, the more evidence supporting a biological underlying process generating them.

## Transitivity
The first topological property to be assessed is the transitivity or Clustering Coefficient ($cl$) [@Kolaczyk:2014cu, p. 56]. $$cl(G) = 3\tau_{\triangle}(G) / \tau_{3}(G)$$ where $\tau_{\triangle}(G)$ is the number of triangles in the graph $G$ and $\tau_{3}$ the number of connected triplets of the form $\wedge$. Transitivity inform about the frequency with which the triplets form triangles in the network an is a measure of how closseness is one vertex to another, thus providing information about clustering of nodes.
```{r transitivity_validation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Degree Preserving Randomization of the simulated clustering coefficient

interactomeTrans <- cl_against_random(interactomeGraph, 1000, 25)
toc() # 5.864 sec elapsed

# The plot
interactome_trans.plot <- ggplot(data = interactomeTrans$simulated_df, aes(x = Transitivity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.0008, alpha = .5) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(interactomeTrans$simulated_df[1:1000, 1], na.rm = TRUE)), linetype = "dashed", size = 0.7, color = "red") +
  ylab("P(cl)") +
  xlab("cl") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = interactomeTrans$observed_cl, y = 200, xend = interactomeTrans$observed_cl, yend = 10),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")), colour = "#00BFC4", alpha = 0.8, size = 0.8
  ) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.06, y = 280, label = paste("Observed\ncl = ", round(interactomeTrans$observed_cl, digits = 3)), size = 4)
interactome_trans.plot
ggsave(filename = "Figures/interactome_trans.pdf")
saveRDS(interactomeTrans, file = "Data/Individual/interactome_trans.rds")
```

Recall that the null hypothesis for the Z-socre is: $$H_0 = cl_{simulated}(interactome) = cl_{observed}(interactome)$$ Therefore, with a confidence level of 99%, a $Z-score > +2.58$ or $Z-score < -2.58$ means that the observed clustering coefficient is very far away, in standard deviations, from the random value, obeying instead a biological processes.

## Average path length
Paths, trials without repeting vertices, are measures of reachability and information flow. Pertaining real-world networks, paths are particularly short in length, despite their usually large size, [@Watts:1998db; @Albert:1999kf] compared against random networks.

```{r APL_validation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  xlab("l") +

saveRDS(interactomeAPL, file = "Data/Individual/interactome_apl.rds")
```

## ERGM
To further analyse the biological validity of the interactome, it will be fitted against the dyadic-independent model, where the likelihood of a tie doesn’t depend on any other (*a.k.a.* Erd\"{o}s-Rényi or Bernulli model), from the Exponential-family of Random Graph models (ERGM), expecting that the observed distribution of some network metrices (degree, geodesic length and edge-wise shared partners (*i.e.*, the number of neighbors shared by a pair of vertices defining an edge)) differ from that of the exponential random model [@Kolaczyk:2014cu, p. 87]. ERGM employs a logistic regression for parameter estimation of the form $$P(Y_{ij} | Y_{i′j′}, \theta) = logistic \sum _{h = 1} ^{k} \theta _h \delta _h ^{ij} (Y)$$ Where $Y_{ij}$ is a binary random variable indicating if there is an edge between a pair of vertices ${i,j}$, $Y_{i′j′}$ is binary random variable for the other vertices, $\theta$ is the coefficient of the statisthic $\delta$ [@Kolaczyk:2014cu, p. 86]. The chosen model only contains an edge term, *it es*, for each pair ${i,j}$, we assume that $Y_{ij}$ is independent of $Y_{i′,j′}$ , for any ${i′,j′} \neq {i,j}$ [@Kolaczyk:2014cu, p. 86].

                                           directed = FALSE,
                                           vertex.attrnames = A.v.attrs)
interactomeGraph.net

# To ensure reproducibility in pseudo-random number generator
set.seed(0)  # Only execute if previously you have not executed it!

# Fitting the random model, which in this case is the bernoulli or Erdos-Renyi model.
interactomeGraph.model <- ergm(interactomeGraph.net ~ edges, control = control.ergm(parallel = detectCores() - 1, parallel.type = "PSOCK"))

# Extracting the result of fitting the random model to the interactome
summary(interactomeGraph.model)

# The log-odds of any ocurring edge is
plogis(coef(interactomeGraph.model)[['edges']])  # = 0.0012574
```

The probability to draw an edge in the interactome randomly is very low (0.0012574), in other words, it is very unlikely that the edges of the interactome are drawn from a Bernulli or Erd\"os-Rényi model. Such observation is further supported by a log-odd of `r exp(-6.68)`, meaning that the model does not affect the odds of drawing an edge between two nodes.

Similarly, one can observe the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC): 608120 and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): 608136 which has very high values. Both criterion measures how well the choosen model explains the original dataset (edges in the interactome) taking care of overfitting by penalising for the number of parameters choosen (AIC penalises softer than BIC). In both cases the smaller, the better fit the model the observed dataset. 
Once the random model have been fitted to the interactome, is time to assess the goodness-of-fit of such relation, by comparing the observed network statistics against the random ones, expecting those to be diffferent and thus representing an overall poor fitting. 

```{r goodness_of_fit_degree, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
# Check for ~ degree + shared partner + geodesic distance + edge at the same time. This is computationally expensive, therefore it is better to perform the gof metric by metric
# interactomeGraph.model.gof <- gof(interactomeGraph.model)

# Check for degree only
tic()
interactomeGraph.model.gof.deg <- gof(interactomeGraph.model ~ degree,
  control = control.gof.formula(nsim = 100, parallel = detectCores() - 1, parallel.type = "PSOCK")
)
toc()
```

```{r goodness_of_fit_degree_plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= "Figure 5. P(k) is not product of random expectation", fig.align="center", warning=FALSE}
pdf("Figures/interactomeGraph.model.gof.deg.plot.pdf")
plot(interactomeGraph.model.gof.deg, xlim = c(0,20))
dev.off()
```

It is evident that the overall poor fit of the random degree to the interactome's degree distribution and it is more notable for low degree values. 

```{r goodness_of_fit_edges, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
# Check for edges only
tic()
interactomeGraph.model.gof.edge <- gof(interactomeGraph.model,
  GOF = ~model,
  control = control.gof.ergm(nsim = 100, parallel = detectCores() - 1, parallel.type = "PSOCK")
)
toc()
interactomeGraph.model.gof.edge
```

In this case the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is $$d_{simulated}(Bernulli) = d_{observed}(interactome)$$ It is, the interactome has the number of edges per vetex, representing its topology, governed by a random process. Hence, a p-value of 0.4 means that the interactome and the Bernulli networks are simmilar. *Why does this occuer? Is the H0 correct? is the interpretation correct? what is the * Note that the number of observations are the number of edges in the network.

```{r goodness_of_fit_geodesic_plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= "Figure 6. Geodesic distance is not product of random expectation", fig.align="center", warning=FALSE}
# # Checks for geodesic distance only
tic()
interactomeGraph.model.gof.dis <- gof(interactomeGraph.model ~ distance,
                                 control = control.gof.ergm(nsim = 100, parallel = detectCores() - 1, parallel.type = "PSOCK"))
toc()
pdf(file = "Figures/interactomeGraph.model.gof.dis.plot.pdf")
plot(interactomeGraph.model.gof.dis, plotlogodds = TRUE)
dev.off()
```

As seen in the log-odds plot, the overall fit of the random geodesic distance to that obeserved in the interactome is quite poor, suggesting that such difference is due to the biological process that gave the interactome its topological property.
