## Abstract
The Rapid eye movement sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) is a promising biomarker for early diagnosis of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), however, little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. The meagre attempts to investigate it use a fragmentary single-gene centred approach, disregarding key molecular entities, interactions and biological processes in the RBD aetiology. Under the systemic paradigm of network medicine, RBD arises from the disruption of a disease module in the network of a cell' physical interactions, or Human Interactome (HI). This research aimed to characterise, for the first time, the RBD-module in an up-to-date high-quality brain-specific HI, employing the DIAMOnD algorithm for disease module prediction. The HI and the RBD-module were validated topologically, utilising exponential random graph model fitting and comparisons against random expectation, and functionally, using a novel network enrichment analysis test, for the former, and the evolutionary framework of the duplication-acquisition model, for the latter. DIAMOnD expanded the molecular pathogenesis of RBD from 26 isolated molecular entities to over 400 interacting molecular entities. The RBD-module not only recovers the well-known role of immune and signalling processes in the sleep regulation, represented by overenrichment with biological process and cellular compartments related to cytokine and serotonin metabolism, but also supports an alternative RBD aetiological hypothesis including limbic structures and suggesting a wider pathogenic view than previously considered for RBD. This study shows the utility of the holistic approach of network medicine to improve our disease understanding and paves the way for further studies guided to disclose the molecular relationship between RBD and synucleinopathies, especially PD,  strengthening its potential as their biomarker.
